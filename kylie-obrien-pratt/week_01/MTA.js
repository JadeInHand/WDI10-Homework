// MTA

// // don't need to use constructors or factories for MTA. stick to arrays of strings
// Find indexes of the start and finish stations
// Aim to set up arrays and objects at minimum
//  The program should work out which stops you need to go to like Trip Planner
// Program should state which stations you need to go through and the total number of stations
// You don't know what direction you're going to be going in - you could go forward or backwards or both
// Union Square is where they change from one line to another line

// You don't need to prompt the user for input, hard code planTrip = function()
// Get program to work for one line before you tackle multiple lines

// Tell the user the number of stops AND the stops IN ORDER that they will pass through or change at.
// The key to the lab is finding the index positions of each stop. (hint: indexOf())


planTrip('N', 'Times Square', '6', '33rd');

indexOf();

var planrip = function (trip)

console.log("You must travel through the following stops on the " + line + " line: " + stop + ".");

// console.log() shows output similar to this:
// "Your must travel through the following stops on the N line: 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square."
// "Change at Union Square."
// "Your journey continues through the following stops: 23rd, 28th, 33rd."
// "7 stops in total."
